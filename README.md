# Having a decoupled iOS Application on a very simple feature

**Xcode version:** 14.2.1

Hello and welcome! ðŸ‘‹ In this repository you'll find:

- An implementation of SwiftUI + **MVVM** design pattern, in a very basic way without any Reactive framework.
- A completely decoupled loading system for any source of data with a **Repository** approach.
- A reusable HTTP GET client based on Foundation's loading system **URLSession**.
- An API definition to model the API.
- And more importantly, we have created a decoupled feature that can be isolated, mocked, and tested on each layer.

Happy Coding <3
